## **My Blog**

Setting up a personal blog to document my learning journey as I progress in the Data Science field. I'll be posting regularly to give the step-by-step methodologies I will be using to complete the various projects I'll be working on.

Hope you find it a good resource on how to use some basic machine learning models as well as get a better understanding of the data science pipeline in general.

Enjoy!
