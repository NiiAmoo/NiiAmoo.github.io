Nii's a fun open-minded guy with a lot of interests without all the time in the world to follow them all. So he did what he had to, prioritise and pursue those interests that promised to give him the highest level of satisfaction. Playing with data turned out to be one of them,others include playing video games (particularly fond of the **FIFA** and **CALL OF DUTY** franchise), reading, listening to music, abstract art and travel.

With regards to working in the Data Science space, he's knowledgable in using Excel, R, Python, SQL, PowerBi, Tableau for analysis and visualizations. 

His favourite book is *Jeffery Archer's - The Sins of the Father*. He's currently going through "*Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus (Oâ€™Reilly)*. 

I'll be writing primarily about my journey working in the Data Science field, what and how I'm learning as well as how to apply them to solving real world problems because I believe that's the end game for any form of analysis to draw out insights or machine learning model to predict or classify events - to solve a problem.
